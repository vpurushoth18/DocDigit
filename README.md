# DocDigit

Main Objectives of the project 
• Create robust vision-language models tailored for document digitization across various document types, including
printed, handwritten, and hybrid documents in English, Sinhala, and Tamil.
• Develop a unified foundation model for document AI that integrates text, image, and layout modalities for diverse
document types and tasks, including understanding and generation.
• Implement episodic memory querying to summarize key visual elements across multiple sequential documents, enabling
the model to answer free-form questions about document structures and layouts based on past events.
• Create and adapt self-supervised learning pretext tasks to pretrain vision-language foundation models for document
digitization in downstream tasks.
